This archive contains the distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-LocalBrew,
version 0.02:

  Verify that your distribution tests well in a fresh perlbrew

To test this distribution, you'll need network connectivity (or
a local mirror of CPAN) and a "fresh" perlbrew environment.
What I mean by fresh is that no non-core modules have been
installed into it.  Once you have it, put their names
into the TEST_PERLBREW environment variable.
